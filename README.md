# Nilami
##Primary Goals: 
 My project goal is to create an application which would set a portal for buying and selling stuff through auctions. 
This “Nilami” app would have the following features: -
    • It would  display the items which will be available for auction in the upcoming weeks with the starting date of auction and minimum price. 
    • It will also provide a feature of mentioning the items in which you are interested so you are notified about them when the auction starts.
    • It displays the ongoing auctions (you have participated in or are interested in) with the details of product and the current highest bid with an option to raise the bid. It also displays if you are the highest bidder.
    • This app also notifies the previous highest bidder if the bid is raised.
    • When the auction ends the highest bidder is given the information about the seller and vice- versa.
    • To notify the seller whenever the highest bid changes.

##Issues faced
  I had a hard time to get familier with git.But all the seniors helped,so eventually I understood it.

  I tried working with firestore to begin with, but I could not figure out using livedata and viewmodel (there were only some docs available which I was not able to comprehend as a beginner) with it and hence had to shift to realtime database in the end.
